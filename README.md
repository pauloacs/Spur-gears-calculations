# Spur-gears-calculations

Codes in python used to study correction on spur gears and it's impact on hertzian contact pressure. 

## Code and executable for calculation of correction

## Code and executable for calculation and representation of hertzian contact pressure along the gearing line

-executable capable of automatically calculate tooth correction, hertzian contact pressure and visual representation of the last one. 

Some of the representations were done in matlab.
